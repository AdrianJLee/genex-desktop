/**
 * Play for a game being made: Genex starts the newest app the game's own folder holds for this
 * computer (an Unreal package in `unreal/Builds/Mac/`, say), in the same game sandbox and full
 * screen as a game from Play (`native-launch.ts`). The app runs where it is, read-only: nothing is
 * copied, re-signed or written into the game folder, so what Publish sends stays as the agent built
 * it; its saves and temporary files live in Genex's own folder. An app older than the game's last
 * change (`isStaleBuild`, the rule Publish keeps) is not played: the chat's agent packages again
 * first. One copy of a game runs at a time; Play again brings its window forward.
 * Electron-free: the launcher, the folder's builds and the clock are deps.
