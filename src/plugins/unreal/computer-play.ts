/**
 * The studio's `computer` tool playing an Unreal game (`shared/engine-play.ts`): a play session in
 * the game's own editor (Play In Editor), driven through the Genex editor helper the editor queue
 * already uses — keys held on the game's own clock, one frame of the player's mouse (looking, the
 * wheel; its buttons are keys), a shot of what the player sees, the player's state. Each tool takes the editor lock for its call (`needs: ["editor"]`), the person first.
 *
 * A session joins a play that is already running rather than restarting it, and ends only a play
 * it started itself. A play it started is marked as the agent's (`agent-play.ts`) while it runs, so
 * the lock's person-first probe does not read it as the person playing; a session whose plugin
 * restarted takes over the play that mark still claims, and ends it. While the editor queue still has a part or a play-check of the game to run,
 * the editor is the queue's: a session is refused (`busy`) rather than playing over it.
 *
 * Unreal plays one player: a play of more players, or a call for any player but the first, is
 * refused as `unsupported` before anything reaches the editor.
